for maintaining levels of abstraction. Traditionally, this view has been
formalized algebraically, but the algebraic approach fails to encompass
higher-order functions.  For this purpose, it is necessary to generalize
homomorphic functions to relations; the result is an `abstraction' theorem
that is applicable to the typed lambda calculus and various extensions,
including user-defined types. Finally, we consider polymorphic functions,
and show that the abstraction theorem captures Strachey's concept of
parametric, as opposed to ad hoc, polymorphism.",
