Abstraction and Invariance for Algebraically Indexed Types

This directory contains Coq sources for the POPL submission named
above. Note that the framework is quite a bit simpler than the
original paper, as we can prove non-inhabitation results using
"model-based" environments, and so we have no need for
"pre-substitutive" or "quantifier-free" qualification. See units.v for
an example of a non-inhabitation proof.

To compile, you will need Coq 8.3pl4 or Coq 8.4, together with
ssreflect 1.4.

The sources are as follows

exp.v
-----

This defines the syntax of index expressions, notions of renaming and
substitution, and equational theories. It corresponds to Figure 2 (top
part), and parts of Section 3.1.

ty.v 
---- 

This defines the syntax of types and terms. It corresponds
to Sections 3.1, Figures 2 (bottom part) and 3.

model.v
-------

This defines the notion of model from Section 3.4.

sem.v
-----

This defines the index-erasure semantics of types and terms as
described in Section 3.2.1, the relational interpretation of types as
described in Section 3.2.2, and contains a proof of lemma 2 and the
Abstraction Theorem, based on the models defined in model.v.

equivalence.v 
------------- 

This defines the notion of contextual equivalence and of semantic
equivalence from Section 3.3, and contains a proof that semantic
equivalence soundly models contextual equivalence (Theorem 2).

units.v 
------- 

This contains an example theory, namely that of scalings as shown in
Figure 1. It contains example proofs of non-inhabitation and scaling.

unitsext.v
----------

This contains an extension of the theory of scalings that includes
a square root operation with polymorphic type. We then prove that 
the "cube root type" is uninhabited.

geometry.v 
---------- 

This contains another example theory, namely that of 2-d translations
as described in Sections 2.1 - 2.3.


geometryext.v
-------------

Extended geometry example, formalizing Example 7. No applications of
invariance yet.

cuberoot.v
----------

Proof that, with types indexed by an abelian group, the cube root
functions is not definable, even if we have a square root
function. The names in this file still mention 'vectors' and
'translations', but the result holds for any type indexed by an
abelian group, with the group operations.
