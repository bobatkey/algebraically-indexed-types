This directory contains Coq sources for the POPL submission named above.

To compile, you will need Coq 8.3pl4 or Coq 8.4, together with ssreflect 1.4.

The sources are as follows

syn.v
-----
This defines the syntax of index expressions, notions of renaming and substitution,
equational theories, and the syntax of types and terms. It corresponds to Sections 3.1,
Figures 2 and 3, and contains a proof of lemma 1 from the paper.

model.v
-------
This defines the notion of model from Section 3.4. 

sem.v
-----
This defines the index-erasure semantics of types and terms as described in Section 3.2.1,
the relational interpretation of types as described in Section 3.2.2, and contains a
proof of lemma 2 and the Abstraction Theorem, based on the models defined in model.v.

equivalence.v 
------------- 
This defines the notion of contextual equivalence and of semantic
equivalence from Section 3.3, and contains a proof that semantic
equivalence soundly models contextual equivalence (Theorem 2).

units.v 
------- 
This contains an example theory, namely that of
scalings as shown in Figure 1. It contains example proofs of
non-inhabitation and scaling.

geometry.v 
---------- 
This contains another example theory, namely
that of 2-d translations as described in Sections 2.1 - 2.3.
